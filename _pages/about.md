Hi!👋
I’m **Fatemeh**, a first-year PhD student in Electrical Engineering at **New York University (NYU)** under the supervision of [Prof. Anna Choromanska](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/anna-choromanska).👩‍🎓  

My research focuses on Deep learning and autonomous driving—particularly on building deep learning models that can generalize across different driving environments.🚙

I received my B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Computer Engineering from the **University of Tehran**. During my undergraduate studies, I conducted research on learning-based robotic grasping, and my thesis was published at the **32nd International Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE 2024)**.📚

Outside of academics, I enjoy cooking, exploring New York City, and watching movies in my downtime.🎬
