I am a PhD student in Electrical Engineering at New York University, specializing in AI and Autonomous Driving. 
My research focuses on domain adaptation, neural network architectures, and optimization methods for autonomous systems.

I received my B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering (Control Systems) from the University of Tehran, with a minor in Computer Engineering, 
graduating in the top 3 of my field. My undergraduate thesis involved mapping human grasping patterns to 3-finger grippers 
using deep learning and computer vision.

I am passionate about applied machine learning research, mentoring the next generation of engineers, 
and developing ethical AI systems that enhance human capabilities.
