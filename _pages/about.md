I am a PhD student in Electrical Engineering at **New York University**, specializing in **AI and Autonomous Driving**.  
My research focuses on domain adaptation, neural network architectures, and optimization for autonomous systems.

Previously, I earned my B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering (Control Systems) with a minor in Computer Engineering from the **University of Tehran**, graduating among the top 3 in my field. My undergraduate thesis involved mapping human grasping patterns to 3-finger robotic grippers using deep learning and computer vision.
