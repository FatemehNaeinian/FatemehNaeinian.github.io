We present a deep learning approach to map human grasping patterns to 3-finger robotic grippers. A dataset was generated using human hand features, with pre-processing steps employing MediaPipe to extract precise finger coordinates. The model was trained using object detection and computer vision techniques to identify optimal grasping points for robotic manipulation.
